Meeting 1
- things to check out: how correlation changes based on the date range (like if covid affected strength of correlation or other world events)
- specifically look at a particular asset/etf
- check out shorter periods of time (not just a day)
- tech sector
- form some kind of macro hypothesis; it's expected that xx follows xx because xxx and yyy

Meeting 2
- a minute is pretty long, try to look into by the second or something more granular

Meeting 3
- try lag for milliseconds
- try for shorter blocks of time

Macro hypotheses:
- Hypothesis 1: it's expected qqq follows spy since spy reflects broad-market shifts, which qqq then adjusts to
- Hypothesis 2: xlk follows qqq because qqq contains mega-cap tech names w/ heavier weightings
- Hypothesis 3: iwm follows spy, since small-caps are less liquid + incorporate info more slowly, while large-caps react faster to macro news
